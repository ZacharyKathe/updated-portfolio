            Using Notepad++, I mapped out my three favorite buildings from my time at the University of Washington. The outlined buildings have pop-ups with a little information.
            I used html, JavaScript, GeoJSON, and Leaflet to showcase my ability to creat a web map.

        <p class="page_1_allign_left_dark" id="esriText">I made this story map in ArcGIS Online as a project for a maps and health class at the University of Washington. I used R for computations and data wrangling in order to produce thematic maps. My goal was to show how many people are affected by addiction and mental illness. Moreover, I provided an interactive map of the Seattle's metropolitan area with over 100 different in-patient facilities. The map pop-ups display the name, location, and website for each location.</b></p1>

          <p class="teal_text">At 25, I was living on my sisters couch in a 1 bedroom apartment. I had a come-to-God moment in my life and decided I wanted to put more effort into my future. I started community college at 
            North Seattle community in 2016. I worked ridiculously hard to accumulate a 3.4 gpa in order to apply for the University of Washington. I was accepted into the Geography department where
            I fell in love with tech. I learned the computer language R, in order to do statistical modeling that lead to graphing. While at the UW I specialized in Geographic information systems and informatics. I met my future wife during this time and our baby boy was born soon after.
            My internship was with the city of Seattle as a GIS analyst. I did that for a year and a half until I graduated December 2020. With my graduate work in Python and full-stack web development, I look forward to
            building applications in the real world. Now, my goal is to unequivocally provide for my family. My motivation and drive to succeed will never slow down because I know what it feels like to have nothing.
