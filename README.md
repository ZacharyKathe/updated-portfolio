### This is my work as an undergraduate, graduate and now coding bootcamp student neatly gathered as a portfolio

#### This showcases a web hosted map with Leaflet, an ArcGIS Online story map, pitch-video of a child development app, password generator, and Travel Buddy website created as a team project. I did the back-end work with the Ticetmaster API using jQuery to dynamically style to html page. I also, integrated the Covid-19 data map.
